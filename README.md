# MATLAB Linear Regression Class

`Linregressor` is a MATLAB class to manage calculating linear regression with uncertainty measurements. The class uses a least-squares linear regression and provides methods for accessing SSE as well as dominant error (the greater of SSE and extrapolation error at any given point).
